# DOPLRP_instances

Each instance considers an specific number of clients that ranges between 2, 200 and 3, 800 located in France. To compute distances between customers, the Harvesian distance is used. In addition, to compute driving and walking times they consider a driving speed of 30 km/h and a walking
speed of 4 kilometers/hours. The service time of each customer is 2 minutes. Finally, the maximum walking distance between two clients is 3.5 km, the maximum walking daily distance for each worker is 16 kilometers, the time limit for each walking subtour is 2 hours and the day duration is 8 hours (i.e., 480 minutes). The fixed cost of hiring a technician is 375 (€) and the driving cost is 0.5€/km

Each txt file contains, the client number, longitude, lattitude, and the time service in minutes.
